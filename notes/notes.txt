Things to figure out:

Are tcp stacks always dependent on TUN/TAP?
Is there a more general interface?

  tcp::init(Device* dev);
  dev->send(); dev->recv();

How to handle async? 
What do we need to do async-ly?
Currently we send something, then wait for reply.
Async not required for single connection stuff.

TCP need to inspect IP source and dest addresses to match incoming packets to
TCBs. 

How to calculate window size?
Use a constant for now.

How to generate initial sequence number?
Use a constant for now, use SystemTime::micros() later.

SND.UNA
SND.NXT

SEG.ACK
SEG.SEQ
SEG.LEN

RCV.NXT

Acceptable ACK:   SND.UNA < SEG.ACK =< SND.NXT
Valid Receive :   RCV.NXT =< SEG.SEQ < RCV.NXT+RCV.WND
               or RCV.NXT =< SEG.SEQ+SEG.LEN-1 < RCV.NXT+RCV.WND


How to deal with packets that arrive out of order?

  ie, RCV.NXT < SEG.SEQ < RCV.NXT+RCV.WND
            ^^^^^
              strictly less than
