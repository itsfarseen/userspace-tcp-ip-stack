                               RFC 793 - TCP/IP
                               ================  

Header
------

Src Port    - 16 bits
Dst Port    - 16 bits
Seq num     - 32 bits
Ack num     - 32 bits
Data Offset - 4 bits       - Number of 32 bit words in TCP header
Reserved    - 6 bits       - Zeroes
URG   \                    - Urgent Pointer field significant
ACK    |
PSH    | ----  6 bits
RST    |    (1 bit each)
SYN    |
FIN   /
Window      - 16 bits      - Number of data octets starting from ack num field
                             that this sender is willing to accept
Checksum    - 16 bits
Urgt Ptr    - 16 bits
Options     - (8xn bits)   - List of options
Padding     -              - To make sure TCP header ends and data begins on a 
                             32 bit boundary
Data        -              - IP will give us a fixed size packet.  
                             Data is whatever remaining after previous fields.



* Establishing connection involves SYN flag and exchange of three messages.
* Sender indicates in each SEND call using PSH flag whether the data upto and
  including that call should be immediately pushed through to the receiving
  user.
* When the receiving TCP sees the PUSH flag, it must not wait for more data from
  the sending TCP, before passing the data to the receiving process.
* Urgent is rarely used
  (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9153566/difference-between-push-and-urgent-flags-in-tcp)
* Checksum is 16bit 1's complement of 1's complement sum of all 16bit words in
  the header and text.
  For calculations:
  - If a segment contains odd number of octets, the last octet is padded on the
    right with zeros to form a 16bit word.
  - Checksum field itself is replaced with zeroes.
* Option length is inclusive of option kind and option length fields.
* MSS - Maximum Segment Size
  Communicates the max receive segment size at the TCP which sends this segment.
  Must only be sent in the initial connection request. (ie, in segs with SYN set)
  If not specified, an segment size is allowed.


Sequence Numbers
----------------

* ACK is cumulative. 
  ACK n means all octets upto but not including n is acknowledged.
* All arithmetic must be done modulo 2^32 
* =< means less than or equal modulo 2^32 (sic)

We need to check:
  * An ACK refers to a sent, unacknowledged seq num.
  * All seq nums of a segment has been ACKed.
  * Incoming segment contains seq numbers which are expected.
    Segment overlaps the receive window.
    ie, detect and ignore duplicate data.

SND.UNA: Oldest unacked seq num
SND.NXT: next seq num to send
SEG.ACK: ACK field of a segment = next seq num expected by receiving TCP.
SEG.SEQ: First seq num of this segment
SEG.LEN: No of octets occupied by data in the segment.
         counting SYN and FIN --- What does this mean?
                                  Do we count SYN as one even if no data?
                                  (A: Yep! See [Implicit Sequence Numbers] below)
Acceptable ack:
  SND.UNA < SEG.ACK =< SND.NXT

A segment is considered fully acknowledged if:
  SEG.SEQ + SEG.LEN =< SEGrecvd.ACK

RCV.NXT: Next seq num expected on an incoming seg.
          = lower edge of recv window.
RCV.NXT + RCV.WND - 1
       : Last seq num expected on an incoming seg.

A received segment is (atleast partially) valid if:
  RCV.NXT =< SEG.SEQ < RCV.NXT + RCV.WND
or
  RCV.NXT =< SEG.SEQ + SEG.LEN - 1 < RCV.NXT + RCV.WND

Zero Windows:

A TCP is allowed to have Zero Receive Windows while transmitting data and
receiving ACKs. However, a TCP must still process the RST and URG fields.

SEG.LEN  RCV.WND  Test
-------  -------  ---------------------
  0        0     SEG.SEQ = RCV.NXT
  0       >0     RCV.NXT =< SEG.SEQ < RCV.NXT + RCV.WND
 >0        0     not acceptable
 >0       >0     RCV.NXT =< SEG.SEQ < RCV.NXT + RCV.WND
                or RCV.NXT =< SEG.SEQ + SEG.LEN - 1 < RCV.NXT + RCV.WND

Implicit Sequence Numbers:

- For allowing retransmission and ACKing, SYN and FIN are assigned seq nums,
  even though they are not carried in the data area.
- SYN is considered to occur before the first data octet.
- FIN is considered to occur after the last data octet.
- SEG.LEN includes both data and these flags which occupy the seq space.

Initial Sequence Number Selection:

SYN stands for Synchronizing initial sequence numbers of sender and receiver.

TCP allows connection reuse. A connection is defined by a pair of sockets. ie,
pairs of sockets can be reused. socket = address + port.
If a segment from a previous incarnation of a connection is received, we might
erroneously accept it. We avoid this by choosing ISNs using a clock and by using
the Quiet Time Concept.

ISN Generator: Bound to a 32 bit clock whose low order bit is incremented
roughly every 4 micro seconds. This cycles approx. every 4.55 hours.
MSL is usually less than this. So we can assume ISNs will be unique.
Note: This only ensures ISN's uniqueness, not seq nums of all packets.

ISR - ISN of Receiving TCP
ISS - ISN of Sending TCP

SYN Procedure:

A --> B   SYN my seq num is X
A <-- B   ACK your seq num is X
A <-- B   SYN my seq num is Y
A --> B   ACK your seq num is Y

Here 3 & 4 can be combined. So we get a 3 step process.
This is known as the three way handshake.

Quiet Time Concept:

This is to make sure that no old packet still in the network has a seq num equal
to the ISN. TCP must keep quiet for MSL time before assigning any sequence
number up on starting up. Do the same if the TCP loses memory of previous seq
nums.

RFC 793 assumes MSL = 2 mins.


Establishing a connection
-------------------------


Notes
-----

*   Section 3.6 of RFC 793, describing TCP's handling of the IP
    precedence and security compartment, is mostly irrelevant today.

    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7414#section-2 (page 6)

*   [RFC2873] removes from the TCP specification all processing of 
    the precedence bits of the TOS byte of the IP header.
